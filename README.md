# Research-Paper-Prevalence-Skills
Year-long research project investigating the prevalence of technical and social skills within information technology training programs.

Abstract:
Information technology is one of the largest growing industries in the world and has a steady growth in the job market. Past research and articles have noted the importance of both technical and social skills in information technology specialists. In addition, researchers have shown the importance of training programs and onboarding programs for maximizing efficiency in any industry. These findings from previous research papers led to the question: What is the prevalence of social skills within the most relevant information technology based training programs, and what are the implications of the results?

In order to find the prevalence of social skills within IT training programs, nine sources were selected to identify 89 total training programs. Those 89 programs were analyzed using a conceptual content analysis approach. To limit inconsistency, the documents were inspected three times each at different moments and the results discussed.
	
The results reflected the well-known idea that technical skills are the main focus of IT training programs, however, they also revealed the problematic absence of social skills. Of the 995 total skills identified across the 89 training programs, only 25 (2.513%) of them were related to social skills. The implications of the results on onboardings programs and industry efficiency were discussed with a stress on possible future studies.
